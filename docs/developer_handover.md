# Developer Handover: Spiral MCP + SpiralBridge Integration

## Progress
This project is an integration of the `SpiralBridge` feature set into the `spiral-gpt5-init` Mission Control Platform (MCP) server. The integration is functionally complete but blocked from final validation by a persistent environment issue.

Key implementation milestones achieved:
- **Data Model:** The original `better-sqlite3` database was replaced with Prisma. A new, unified schema is defined in `mcp/prisma/schema.prisma` to support rich conversation metadata from `SpiralBridge`, and the initial migration has been created.
- **Core Logic:** The core functionalities of `SpiralBridge` (Harmonic Tone Coherence Analysis and conversation parsing from URLs) were rewritten in TypeScript and placed in `mcp/src/tools/htca.ts` and `mcp/src/tools/oracle_parser.ts`.
- **API Endpoints:** The placeholder endpoints in the MCP server (`/bridge/import`, `/memory/store`, `/memory/retrieve`, etc.) have been fully implemented with the new logic, using the Prisma client for all database operations.
- **CLI Extension:** The `unify` Python CLI script was extended with a `bridge import <url>` command to make the new functionality accessible from the command line. It includes offline URL validation.
- **Documentation:** The main `README.md` has been updated to reflect the new Cross-Oracle Memory Bridge feature, its capabilities, and usage.

## Blockage
The project is currently blocked at the **Testing and Validation** stage.

1.  **Primary Blocker: File System Anomaly**: There is a critical and persistent issue with the shell environment. The `mcp/` directory, while visible with `ls`, is inaccessible via `cd`. Any command attempting to navigate into this directory fails with a "No such file or directory" error. This prevents all server-side operations, including starting the server, running builds, and executing tests.

2.  **Secondary Blocker: Test Environment Setup**: As a consequence of the primary blocker, the end-to-end integration test (`tests/test_integration.py`) cannot run. The test requires starting the MCP server, which fails due to the file system issue preventing access to the server's source files and the inability to properly configure the `.env` file with the necessary API keys.

3.  **Backup Creation Failed**: An attempt to create a `.tar.gz` backup of the project also failed due to environment errors related to the file system anomaly and the `tar` command itself.

## Next Steps for Human Developer
The immediate priority is to resolve the file system issue to regain access to the `mcp/` directory.

1.  **Resolve File System Issue**: Please follow the detailed diagnostic and repair steps provided by the Spiral in the previous turn (timestamp: 2025-08-13 11:37:43.364386). This involves checking permissions, looking for broken symbolic links, and potentially repairing the filesystem.

2.  **Validate Server Setup**: Once access to `mcp/` is restored, create the `.env` file as specified in the instructions (with dummy keys for Stripe, etc.) to allow the server to start. Run `npm install` and `npx prisma generate` from within the `mcp` directory.

3.  **Run Full Test Suite**: Execute `pytest` from the root directory. The integration test in `tests/test_integration.py` will likely need the environment variable injection method suggested in the user's guidance to pass reliably.

4.  **Final Polish**: Once all tests pass, the integration can be considered complete. The project will be ready for further development or deployment.
